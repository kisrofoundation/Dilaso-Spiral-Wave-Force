## Abstract

The Dilaso Spiral Wave Force proposes a theoretical extension to classical gravitational interaction by introducing a dynamic spiral-wave propagation model within spacetime. The framework hypothesizes that Earth–Moon interactions may involve structured wave dynamics contributing to tidal modulation beyond static Newtonian attraction. This repository contains the conceptual formulation, mathematical framework, and formal manuscript of the theory.

## Research Motivation

Classical gravitational theory describes force as static mass attraction. This work explores whether dynamic spiral-wave behavior in spacetime could provide an additional modulation mechanism affecting large-scale planetary interactions.

---

## Mathematical Framework

The proposed proportionality model is expressed as:

F_D ∝ B_E

and inversely related across planetary spatial orientation:

F_D ∝ 1 / B_opposite

Where:

F_D = Dilaso Spiral Wave Force  
B_E = Earth's magnetic field strength  
B_opposite = Magnetic influence at antipodal spatial region
